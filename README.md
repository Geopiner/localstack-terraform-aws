# ☁️ Cloud Architecture Project

This repository tracks my journey and work toward building a professional cloud architecture portfolio. The goal is to become job-ready as a cloud engineer, with practical experience deploying scalable, maintainable, and secure infrastructure and serverless applications — all within a local development environment using LocalStack and Terraform before migrating to real AWS environments.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🚀 Gain hands-on experience designing, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure with Terraform and AWS services.
- 🛠️ Build a solid foundation with core AWS components: API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM, VPC, and networking.
- 🐳 Use LocalStack for local development and testing to speed iteration and avoid AWS costs during early stages.
- 📂 Develop real-world projects and demos that demonstrate skills needed for cloud engineering roles.
- 🔄 Create reusable Terraform modules and automated CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure-as-code.
- 📖 Prepare detailed documentation and logs to track progress, challenges, and learning points.

---

## 🔍 Current Scope

- ⚙️ Two-tier serverless backend using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB deployed locally with LocalStack.
- 📝 Infrastructure defined and managed via Terraform configurations.
- 🖥️ Local emulation of AWS services with realistic testing workflows.
- 🔐 Environment variable management and secure credentials handling.
- 🐞 Logging and troubleshooting common AWS SDK and Lambda integration issues.

---

## 🚧 Future Plans

- 🏗️ Extend to a full three-tier architecture including a frontend client or static website hosted on S3 + CloudFront.
- 🔐 Integrate IAM roles and policies for fine-grained security.
- 🌐 Add networking layers: VPC, subnets, routing tables, NAT gateways.
- 🤖 Automate deployment with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions or similar).
- 🐳 Explore container orchestration (ECS/EKS) and advanced serverless patterns.
- 📨 Experiment with additional AWS services relevant to cloud engineering roles (SQS, SNS, Step Functions).
- 📁 Prepare comprehensive portfolio-ready projects for job applications.

## 🧰 What I Used

- ▶️ YouTube tutorials to understand AWS concepts and LocalStack.
- 💬 ChatGPT for coding help, debugging, and explanations.
- 🌐 Terraform to declare infrastructure.
- 🐳 LocalStack running in Docker for local AWS service emulation.
