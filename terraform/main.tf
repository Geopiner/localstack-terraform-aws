# main.tf is the central place to define core AWS resources or glue everything together.
# Right now itâ€™s empty because this project organizes resources into separate files 
# (like api_gateway.tf, lambda.tf, dynamodb.tf) for better clarity and management.
#
# Use main.tf to add shared resources, global settings, or dependencies if needed later.
