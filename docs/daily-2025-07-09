## âœ… Summary

- Tried integrating S3 with LocalStack but faced persistent bucket creation hangs and DNS resolution problems.  
- Confirmed that the common fixes like `s3_use_path_style` are outdated and ineffective.  
- Decided to remove all S3-related resources from the project.  
- Concluded that LocalStackâ€™s S3 support is unreliable for this use case.  
- Moving away from LocalStack entirely and will start a new project using actual AWS with a fresh repo.
